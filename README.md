🛒 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
📌 Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment mall customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. It helps businesses identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies and optimized resource allocation.

📂 Dataset
Source: Mall Customers Dataset (Kaggle)
Features used:

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)

⚙️ Key Steps
Data Loading and Cleaning: Loaded dataset and selected relevant features.

Scaling: Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling.

Optimal Clusters: Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

K-Means Clustering: Clustered customers into distinct groups.

Visualization: Plotted customer segments in a 2D scatter plot for clear interpretation.

🔍 Results
Identified distinct customer segments based on spending patterns and income levels.

Visual insights help businesses strategically target each segment to improve sales and retention.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

💡 Future Work
✅ Apply other clustering algorithms (e.g. DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
✅ Perform deeper analysis on average spending per cluster
✅ Integrate clustering results into marketing strategy simulations
